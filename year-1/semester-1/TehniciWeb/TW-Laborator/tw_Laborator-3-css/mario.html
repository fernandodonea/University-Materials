    <h1>Super Mario Brothers</h1>
      <header>
      <p> Super Mario Bros is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros and the first game in the Super Mario series, it was first released in 1985 for the Famicom in Japan.</p>
      <p>The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as <em>a grand culmination</em> of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working on Devil World and the side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu.</p>
